## Overview

EvalForge is a self-hosted, developer-first LLM evaluation platform built for AI engineers, product teams, and researchers who need rigorous, reproducible benchmarking of language model outputs. It replaces ad-hoc evaluation scripts and spreadsheets with a structured platform featuring automated pipelines, a real-time dashboard, a public API, and a judge abstraction layer that unifies G-Eval, DeepEval, AlpacaEval, and custom LLM-as-a-Judge configurations under a single interface.

The core insight behind EvalForge is that LLM evaluation has the same requirements as software testing — it needs to be automated, versioned, reproducible, and integrated into the development workflow. Most teams evaluate LLMs manually before a release, if at all. EvalForge makes evaluation a first-class, continuous process triggered on every model change, prompt change, or data change — the same way unit tests run on every commit.

Key design decisions:

- **Async-first backend**: FastAPI with async SQLAlchemy ensures evaluation jobs — which can involve hundreds of LLM inference calls per dataset — never block the API layer. All long-running work is dispatched to background Celery workers via Redis queues with priority support and dead-letter handling.
- **Decoupled judge abstraction**: The `JudgeBase` abstract class sits between the evaluation pipeline and any specific framework. Swapping from G-Eval to a custom judge requires changing one configuration field, not touching any pipeline code.
- **Immutable dataset versioning**: Every dataset upload creates an immutable version snapshot. Evaluation runs are pinned to a specific version, ensuring results are reproducible even as ground truth evolves over time.
- **Self-hostable with one command**: `docker compose up --build -d` spins up the full stack — FastAPI, React frontend, PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery workers — with no external service dependencies.
- **CI/CD ready by design**: The REST API is the primary interface. Triggering an evaluation run, polling for completion, and fetching results are all achievable with standard HTTP calls, making GitHub Actions or GitLab CI integration trivial.
- **SaaS-ready architecture**: Organisation-level tenancy, team-scoped API keys, usage metering hooks, and subscription plan enforcement are designed into the data model from Phase 1, not retrofitted later.

## Database Schema

The core relational model behind EvalForge. All tables use UUID primary keys. Evaluation runs are immutably linked to a specific dataset version, ensuring past results remain reproducible.

```mermaid

        uuid id PK
        string name
        string slug UK
        string plan
        int monthly_run_limit
        timestamp created_at
    }

    Team {
        uuid id PK
        uuid org_id FK
        string name

## Evaluation Engine Design

The judge abstraction layer is the architectural core of EvalForge. Every metric — regardless of which framework computes it — flows through the same `JudgeBase` interface. This means evaluation pipelines are stable even as the underlying judge implementation changes or new frameworks are added.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    INPUT([Evaluation Request\nmodel output plus reference plus criteria plus metric]) --> VALIDATE[Validate input schema\nPydantic v2]

    VALIDATE --> TEMPLATE[Load Jinja2 Prompt Template\nfor metric and judge combination]
    TEMPLATE --> REGISTRY{Metric Registry\nlookup judge for metric}

    REGISTRY -->|coherence, relevance, correctness, fluency| GEVAL[G-Eval\nChain-of-Thought scoring]
    REGISTRY -->|faithfulness, hallucination, toxicity, answer relevancy| DEEPEVAL[DeepEval\nspecialised modules]
    REGISTRY -->|instruction following winrate| ALPACA[AlpacaEval\npairwise winrate]
    REGISTRY -->|user-defined rubric| CUSTOM[Custom LLM Judge\nJinja2 prompt template]
    REGISTRY -->|A vs B model comparison| PAIRWISE[Pairwise Comparator\nbracket tournament or ELO]

    GEVAL --> RAW[Raw Judge Response\nJSON with score and reasoning]
    DEEPEVAL --> RAW
    ALPACA --> RAW
    CUSTOM --> RAW
    PAIRWISE --> RAW

    RAW --> PARSE[Parse and validate response\nextract score and chain-of-thought]
    PARSE --> NORMALISE[Normalise to 0.0 to 1.0\nper-metric calibration]
    NORMALISE --> STORE[(INSERT TestCaseResult\nPostgreSQL)]
    STORE --> AGGREGATE[Aggregate across N test cases\nmean, median, p10, p90]
    AGGREGATE --> UPDATE[(UPDATE Run aggregate_score\nand status)]
    UPDATE --> BROADCAST[Broadcast progress\nWebSocket or SSE]
    BROADCAST --> DASH([Live dashboard update])
```

## Evaluation Job Lifecycle

The complete sequence of events from the moment a user submits an evaluation job to the moment results are available on the dashboard — including error recovery and cancellation paths.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor User
    participant API as FastAPI Backend
    participant Auth as JWT and RBAC
    participant Limit as Rate and Plan Limiter
    participant SVC as Evaluation Service
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    participant WORKER as Celery Worker
    participant JUDGE as Judge Layer
    participant LLM as External Judge LLM
    participant WS as WebSocket Channel

    User->>API: POST /api/v1/runs with dataset_id, judge, metrics, config

```

## G-Eval Scoring Pipeline

A deep look at how G-Eval specifically works inside EvalForge — the chain-of-thought generation step, the step-level scoring, and how the final metric score is derived.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    INPUT([Test Case\noutput plus reference plus metric name]) --> COT_PROMPT[Build Chain-of-Thought Prompt\nAsk LLM to generate evaluation steps]

    COT_PROMPT --> LLM1[LLM Call 1\nGenerate evaluation steps]
    LLM1 --> STEPS[Ordered list of evaluation steps\ne.g. Check factual accuracy then Check coherence]

    STEPS --> SCORE_PROMPT[Build Scoring Prompt\nInject steps plus output plus reference]
    SCORE_PROMPT --> LLM2[LLM Call 2\nScore each step 1 to 5]

    LLM2 --> STEP_SCORES[Per-step scores\nstep 1 score 4, step 2 score 5, step 3 score 3]

    STEP_SCORES --> WEIGHTED[Apply step weights\nuser-configurable or uniform]
    WEIGHTED --> AGGREGATE[Weighted average]
    AGGREGATE --> NORMALISE[Normalise to 0.0 to 1.0]
    NORMALISE --> STORE[(Store score plus all step reasoning\nin TestCaseResult)]
```

---

## RAG Evaluation Pipeline

How EvalForge evaluates Retrieval-Augmented Generation systems — covering retrieval quality and generation quality as separate, independently scored dimensions.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    RAG_INPUT([RAG Test Case\nquery plus retrieved chunks plus generated answer plus ground truth]) --> SPLIT{Split into\ntwo evaluation tracks}

    SPLIT --> RETRIEVAL_TRACK[Retrieval Quality Track]
    SPLIT --> GENERATION_TRACK[Generation Quality Track]

    subgraph Retrieval [Retrieval Evaluation]
        RETRIEVAL_TRACK --> CTX_PREC[Contextual Precision\nAre retrieved chunks relevant to the query?]
        RETRIEVAL_TRACK --> CTX_RECALL[Contextual Recall\nDo retrieved chunks cover the ground truth?]
        RETRIEVAL_TRACK --> CTX_REL[Context Relevancy\nSignal to noise ratio of retrieved set]
    end

    subgraph Generation [Generation Evaluation]
        GENERATION_TRACK --> FAITHFUL[Faithfulness\nIs the answer grounded in retrieved chunks?]
        GENERATION_TRACK --> ANSWER_REL[Answer Relevancy\nDoes the answer address the original query?]
        GENERATION_TRACK --> HALLUCINATION[Hallucination Check\nDoes the answer introduce unsupported claims?]
    end

    CTX_PREC --> RETRIEVAL_SCORE[Retrieval Score - weighted mean]
    CTX_RECALL --> RETRIEVAL_SCORE
    CTX_REL --> RETRIEVAL_SCORE

    FAITHFUL --> GENERATION_SCORE[Generation Score - weighted mean]
    ANSWER_REL --> GENERATION_SCORE
    HALLUCINATION --> GENERATION_SCORE

    RETRIEVAL_SCORE --> FINAL[Combined RAG Score\nuser-configurable retrieval vs generation weight]
    GENERATION_SCORE --> FINAL
    FINAL --> STORE[(Store dimension scores\nand combined score)]
```

## CI/CD Integration Flow

How EvalForge fits into a standard model deployment pipeline — evaluation as a gate between training and production.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Dev [Development]
        COMMIT[Commit new model\nor prompt change]
    end

    subgraph CI [GitHub Actions or GitLab CI]
        TRIGGER[Workflow triggered\non push to main]
        EVAL_STEP[Run EvalForge step\nPOST to /api/v1/runs]
        POLL[Poll GET /api/v1/runs/id\nuntil COMPLETED or FAILED]
        THRESHOLD{Score above\nconfigured threshold?}
        PASS[Pipeline passes\nProceed to deployment]
        FAIL[Pipeline fails\nBlock merge or deploy]
        TRIGGER --> EVAL_STEP --> POLL --> THRESHOLD
        THRESHOLD -->|Yes| PASS
        THRESHOLD -->|No| FAIL
    end

    subgraph EvalForge [EvalForge Platform]
        API_RECV[Receive run request]
        ASYNC_EXEC[Execute async evaluation job]
        RESULT[Return scored results]
        API_RECV --> ASYNC_EXEC --> RESULT
    end

    subgraph Deploy [Deployment]
        STAGING[Deploy to staging]
        PROD[Promote to production]
        STAGING --> PROD
    end

    COMMIT --> TRIGGER
    EVAL_STEP -->|REST API| API_RECV
    RESULT -->|JSON response| POLL
    PASS --> STAGING
```

---

## Run State Machine

Every evaluation run moves through a defined set of states. Transitions are enforced at the service layer — no direct state mutation is allowed from outside the service.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Pending : Run submitted via API

    Pending --> Running : Worker picks up job from queue
    Pending --> Cancelled : User cancels before worker starts

    Running --> Completed : All test cases evaluated successfully
    Running --> Failed : Unrecoverable error after retries exhausted
    Running --> PartiallyCompleted : Some test cases failed, rest succeeded
    Running --> Cancelled : User cancels mid-execution

    PartiallyCompleted --> Completed : User accepts partial results
    PartiallyCompleted --> Retrying : User triggers retry for failed cases

    Failed --> Retrying : User triggers full retry
    Retrying --> Running : Worker restarts job

    Completed --> [*]
    Cancelled --> [*]
```

---

## SaaS and Multi-Tenancy Architecture

How EvalForge isolates data between organisations and enforces per-plan limits — relevant from Phase 11 onwards but designed into the data model from Phase 1.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    REQUEST([Incoming API Request]) --> AUTH[JWT Verification\nextract userId and orgId]

    AUTH --> TENANT[Tenant Context Middleware\nattach org and team to request]

    TENANT --> RBAC{RBAC Check\nrole and permission}

    RBAC -->|Insufficient permission| DENY[403 Forbidden]
    RBAC -->|Permitted| PLAN[Plan Limit Check\ncheck org monthly_run_limit]

    PLAN -->|Limit exceeded| LIMIT_ERR[429 Plan limit reached\nupgrade prompt]
    PLAN -->|Within limit| SCOPE[Apply org_id scope\nto all DB queries]

    SCOPE --> HANDLER[Route Handler]
    HANDLER --> DB_QUERY[Scoped DB Query\nWHERE org_id = tenant org_id]
    DB_QUERY --> RESPONSE([Scoped response\nno cross-org data leakage])

    subgraph Roles [Role Hierarchy]
        ORG_ADMIN[Org Admin\nfull org access]
        TEAM_ADMIN[Team Admin\nteam-scoped access]
        MEMBER[Member\nread and run within team]
        VIEWER[Viewer\nread-only]
        ORG_ADMIN --> TEAM_ADMIN --> MEMBER --> VIEWER
    end
```

---

## Security Model

EvalForge applies defence-in-depth at every layer. The following table maps each threat to its mitigation.

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Unauthenticated API access | JWT Bearer tokens on all protected routes, short-lived access tokens with refresh token rotation |
| Brute-force login | Rate limiting per IP on `/auth/login`, exponential backoff on repeated failures |
| Cross-tenant data access | `org_id` scope injected into every database query by tenant middleware — no route handler can bypass it |
| SQL injection | SQLAlchemy parameterised queries throughout — no raw string concatenation |
| Privilege escalation | RBAC middleware enforces role hierarchy per operation before any controller logic runs |
| API key compromise | Keys are stored as bcrypt hashes — compromise of the database does not expose raw keys |
| Malicious file upload | Dataset uploads are validated for format, size, and schema before any content is parsed or stored |
| Secrets in environment | All secrets via environment variables, never hardcoded, `.env` excluded from Git and Docker layers |
| Container escape | Docker containers run as non-root users with no unnecessary capabilities |
| Insecure HTTP | HTTPS enforced at the reverse proxy layer (Nginx / Caddy) in all production deployments |
